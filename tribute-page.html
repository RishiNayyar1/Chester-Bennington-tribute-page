        <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be</p>
        <p>Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface</p>
        <p>Don't know what you're expecting of me</p>
        <p>Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes</p>
        <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</p>
        <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
        <p>I've become so numb</p>
        <p>I can't feel you there</p>
        <p>Become so tired</p>
        <p>So much more aware</p>
        <p>I'm becoming this</p>
        <p>All I want to do</p>
        <p>Is be more like me</p>
        <p>And be less like you</p>
        <p>Can't you see that you're smothering me</p>
        <p>Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?</p>
        <p>'Cause everything that you thought I would be</p>
        <p>Has fallen apart right in front of you</p>
        <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you</p>
        <p>(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
        <p>And every second I waste is more than I can take</p>
        <p>I've become so numb</p>
        <p>I can't feel you there</p>
        <p>Become so tired</p>
        <p>So much more aware</p>
        <p>I'm becoming this</p>
        <p>All I want to do</p>
        <p>Is be more like me</p>
        <p>And be less like you</p>
        <p>And I know</p>
        <p>I may end up failing too</p>
        <p>But I know</p>
        <p>You were just like me with someone disappointed in you</p>
        <p>I've become so numb</p>
        <p>I can't feel you there</p>
        <p>Become so tired</p>
        <p>So much more aware</p>
        <p>I'm becoming this</p>
        <p>All I want to do</p>
        <p>Is be more like me</p>
        <p>And be less like you</p>
        <p>I've become so numb</p>
        <p>I can't feel you there</p>
        <p>(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)</p>
        <p>I've become so numb</p>
        <p>I can't feel you there</p>
        <p>(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)</p>
